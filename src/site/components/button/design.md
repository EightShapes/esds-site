## Use When

* Communicating action(s) that a user may take on a page.
* Emphasizing a primary or limited set of actions on a page.
* Progressing a user through a flow across many pages.

### Don't Use When

* Shifting the display to another portion of the page. Instead, use a link.
* Navigating to another page, except within hero marquees. Instead, use a link.
* Offering many less important actions. Instead, use icon buttons, a toolbar, or other similarly compact displays.

## Visual Style

* Maximize the contrast of a button with adjacent elements and the surface on which it resides, particularly if the surface isn't a flat color.

### Layout

* Match button width when stacking vertically, aligning button left and right edges.
* Match button height when arranging horizontally, aligning button top and bottom edges.
* Separate buttons with the generic spacer aligned with the button's size. For example, separate medium buttons with `$esds-space-inline-m`.

## Editorial

* Label a button unambiguously and concisely.
* Clearly describe the event that will occur when the button is clicked.
* Limit labels to three words or less, and strive for one or two words.
* Start with a verb, if possible.
* Avoid clarifying context that may already be clear given the section in which the button resides.
* Use title case.
