## Variants

### Primary

Use a primary button for actions that complete a task or progress a user forward in their journey.

<!-- Example Code Pair -->

### Secondary

Augment primary buttons with one or two secondary buttons for alternative actions that do not progress the user forward.

<!-- Example Code Pair -->

### Flat

Use flat buttons for non-critical actions.

<!-- Example Code Pair -->

### Outline

Use outline buttons for medium-emphasis actions that are important but not primary on the page. Outline buttons enable you to adjust contrast and emphasis relative to adjacent elements, such as the title and description of a card.

<!-- Example Code Pair -->

## Examples

### With Icon

Pair a button label with an icon to improve recognition and/or associate the button with an object.

<!-- Example Code Pair -->

### Icon Only

Display an icon-only button in compact spaces and/or when arranging many actions together, when words won't fit comfortably.

<!-- Example Code Pair -->

## Size

Vary button size to fit appropriately with adjacent elements. Button size varies label font size, icon size, and internal padding.
