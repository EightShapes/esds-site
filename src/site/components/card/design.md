## Use When

- Summarizing an object as an entry point into more detailed display
- Previewing summaries comparatively across multiple related choices
- Displaying a visual gallery or response to search inquiry

### Don't Use When

- No detailed content or page is available. Instead, use an [image], [thumbnail] with [overlay], or custom component.
- Adjacent objects are considerably different conceptually, risking confusion.
- Needing a modular block more generally. Instead, use a [module container] or [tile].

## Visual Style

<!-- Don't truncate a card title, description, or other content  -->

### Layout

Cards can be arranged in a variety of ways: horizontally, vertically, in a grid of rows and columns, or even as masonry.

<esds-do-dont>
  <esds-do
    caption="Use capitalization for languages that allow capitalization."
    src="/images/landscape.png"
  ></esds-do>
  <esds-dont
    caption="Don't wrap text. For maximum legibility, a text label should remain on a single line."
    src="/images/portrait.jpg"
  ></esds-dont>

  <esds-dont
    caption="Don't wrap text. For maximum legibility, a text label should remain on a single line. Don't wrap text. For maximum legibility, a text label should remain on a single line."
    src="/images/portrait.jpg"
  ></esds-dont>
</esds-do-dont>

<!-- Do customize card arrangements for more sophisticated displays -->

<!-- Don't customize arrangements without considering responsive implications -->

- Cards arranged in horizontal or vertical masonry grids can vary in width or height, respectively.
- Always maintain consistent height and width of all cards when arranged in a non-masonry grid.

## Behavior

<!-- Do limit to no more than two [buttons] in the action slot, with only one as a primary button. -->

<!-- Don't include more than two [buttons] in the action slot. -->

<!-- Do enable an entire card to be clickable if no actions are included in an action bar, using the `clickable` property. -->

## Editorial

- Always include a [thumbnail] and title.
- Display an icon specific to the object type when an image asset is unavailable.
- Display the EightShapes logo mark if neither an image asset nor type icon is available.
